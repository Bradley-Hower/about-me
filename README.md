### Reflections and Comments

Lab 02
My experience thus far has been good. I think the key point for me is to make notes of concepts or pieces of code I am less familiar with. This will help me to later come back to these for review and will maximize my learning. Moreover, it allows me to learn things that perhaps I won't necessarily be tested on.

In regards to what I want to learn, the further along I get in the process of understanding what is industry standard, I think it will be easier to know where I want to go with my learning.

Currently, a regular weekly review regarding what I want to learn, with reflection on what I have learned thus far I think is a good plan. This will also help me to orient myself and test my understanding of the concepts.

Lab 03
How do you think your prior life and professional experience will help you in this new endeavor?
My prior work in finance required me to be very organized with hyper attention to detail. This no doubt will be very useful for coding, as even the smallest mistake can break code. I found the lab today to be fun. It was a fun challenge to work through. It's great to be able to use what we learn and then add on top of it a bit of a push, requiring us to work to expand beyond the course material a little. A very useful skill to develop with strength.

Lab 05 
I got stuck on one of the bento problems for much longer than I should have and it was driving me crazy. I finally figured it out after simplifying. I overthink things, always trying to dive so deep when sometimes the fish is just below the surface. I also find I really need to have enough fuel in me. Otherwise, I can not think clearly.
